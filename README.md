# Social links profile
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 🛠 Technologies
- HTML5 — semantic page structure
- CSS3 — custom styling and hover effects
- Flexbox — layout and content alignment
- Google Fonts — typography (Inter)
- CSS Transitions — smooth hover interactions

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?
- Add keyboard focus states for better accessibility
- Improve responsiveness for very small screens
- Add active states for social links
- Enhance semantic structure by grouping related content more clearly
